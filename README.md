# mussel
mussel is the shortest and fastest script available today to build working cross
compilers that target musl libc.

## Features
1. **Up-to-date**: uses latest available upstream sources for packages
2. **Fast**: probably the fastest script around to build a cross compiler
   targetting musl libc, also it's written entirely in POSIX and runs fully
   under DASH
3. **Short**: has the least amount of steps (see below) required to build a
   cross compiler targetting musl libc (even less than
   [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make))
4. **Small**: all installation steps use `install-strip` when applicable
5. **Simple**: easy to read, modify and extend
6. **POSIX Compliant**: the entire script is POSIX compliant and runs entirely
   under DASH
7. **Well Documented**: the script has comments (that are considered state of
   the art information) all over the place explaining what is being done and why

## Requirements:
To confirm you have all required packages, you can execute `./check.sh`.
### For Fedora (32):
```Sh
sudo dnf install bash bc binutils bison bison-devel bzip2 ccache coreutils diffutils findutils gawk gcc gcc-c++ git glibc grep gzip libarchive lzip libzstd-devel m4 make perl rsync sed texinfo xz zstd
```

## Usage
### Build a cross compiler
```Sh
./mussel.sh (arch) (flag)
```

**(arch)**: See **Supported Architectures** below (default is x86_64)

**(flag)**: **--parallel:** Use all available cores on the host system

### Cleaning mussel's build environment
```Sh
./mussel.sh --clean
```

Sources will be preserved.

## Supported Architectures
* aarch64
* armv6zk (Raspberry Pi 1 Models A, B, B+, the Compute Module, and the Raspberry
Pi Zero)
* armv7
* i586
* i686
* powerpc
* powerpc64
* powerpc64le
* riscv64
* x86_64 (default)

## Packages
1. `binutils`: 2.35
2. `gcc`: 10.2.0
3. `gmp`: 6.2.0
4. `isl`: 0.22.1
5. `mpc`: 1.2.0
6. `mpfr`: 4.1.0
7. `musl`: 1.2.0

## How is mussel doing it?
1. Install `musl` headers
2. Configure, build and install cross `binutils`
3. Configure, build and install cross `gcc` (with `libgcc-static`)
4. Configure, build and install `musl`
5. Build, and install `libgcc-shared` only

## Additional Steps
* Build, and install `libstdc++-v3` (For C++ Support) (Enabled by default)
* Build, and install `libgomp` (For OpenMP Support) (Disabled by default)
